\textbf{Al-kitab al-khamr} is the book of forbidden drink. ``Khamr" is the word
in the Q\={u}r'an that prohibits the faithful from intoxicants: from wine and
from stimulants and from bringers-of-visions. What things must those be that
between poison and pleasure tack course in the body? What colors and shapes the
forbidden inscribes as its left-behind marks on dreams and insoluble mind.

\textbf{Instrumentation:}

\begin{itemize} \itemsep2pt
\item Bass flute (doubling flute)
\item English horn (doubling oboe)
\item Bass clarinet (doubling B$\flat$ clarinet)
\item Baritone saxophone (doubling sopranino saxophone)
\item Guitar
\item Piano
\item Percussion
\item Violin
\item Viola
\item Cello
\item Contrabass
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Prioritization of tempo.} The piece comprises two series of different
tempi. Tempo series one sets the quarter note equal to 126, 63 or 31.5 (written
as 32). Tempo series two sets the quarter note equal to 84 or 42. The tempi of
the first series stand 3:2 in relation to the tempi of the second series.
Even though the choice of tempi are to some extent a matter of the preferences
of the ensemble and the acoustics of the hall, the subito changes of tempo in
the piece should be felt and conducted as exact metric modulations. In
addition, the tempi of the very fast parts of the piece should be played as
closely as possible to the tempi written in the score: it is preferable to play
the dense figures in very fast parts of the piece as something of a blur rather
than slowing the tempi to attack the notes carefully.

\textbf{The winds are tranposed.} The bass flute sounds an octave lower than
written. The English horn sounds a perfect fifth lower than written. The
B$\flat$ clarinet sounds a major second lower than written and the bass
clarinet sounds a major ninth lower than written. The baritone saxophone sounds
a major thirteenth lower than written and the sopranino saxophone sounds a
minor third higher than written.

\textbf{Winds.} Trills without secondary noteheads are color trills.

\textbf{Flute.} The two bass flute multiphonics in the piece are numbers 17 and
22 in Carin Levine's book \textit{Die Technik der Fl√∂tenspiel} and the boxed
numbers in the score are reminders of this. Any fingerings approximating the
off-octave sound of the multiphonics may be used.

\textbf{Saxophone.} The multiphonic dyad in the piece is number 77 in Marcus
Weiss's book \textit{Die Technik der Saxophons}; the boxed number in the score
is a reminder of this.

\textbf{Guitar.} The guitar is tuned as usual. Cross noteheads indicate half
harmonics. Individuated clicks indicated in the score should be executed by
running a pick or fingernail laterally up the outer wire weave of the E string
creating a continuous but sparse and irregular sound.

\textbf{Piano.} The piano should be prepared with a piece of cardboard woven
between the strings of twelve notes in the octave from F$\sharp$6 to
F$\sharp$7. The effect is coarsely to mute these pitches; no special indication
is given in the score when these pitches are encountered. `Tamburo' hits
characterize the first section of the piece. Execute these with heel of the
palm struck against the lowest strings inside the piano with the sustain pedal
lifted; the sound augments the color of the tam-tam and is the only type of
inside-the-piano technique requested in the score.

\textbf{Percussion.} The percussion part is notated primarily on a single-line
staff. Where cells of the five-line staff occur they represent a synchoronous
attack on A$\flat$5 in the marimba together with a single woodblock; these two
instruments are always struck together in the piece and should be placed near
each other so that each can be hit with a hard mallet at the same time. The
tam-tam should be as large as possible and the tam-tam dynamics written into
the score may be freely ignored: the goal is as resonant a sound that fills as
much of the hall as possible without spilling over from the fundamental of the
instrument into the less desirable upper frequencies. Rolls on the bass drum
are all to be as close to attackless as possible: the rate of the roll doesn't
matter but the background depth provided by the instrument is important.

\textbf{Strings.} The violin, viola and cello are tuned as usual. String IV of
the contrabass is tuned down to G$\natural$0 (a major sixth lower than the
usual tuning of E$\natural$1); the string may be lose in scordatura but this is
ok. The contrabass plays a special role in the piece and should be allowed to
sound front-and-center above the other strings in many sections of the piece,
as indicated by the dynamics. The string writing that features glissandi
lentissimi in natural harmonics is designed to encourage the production of
multiphonics and other unstable harmonics, especially in the contrabass and
cello: allow the multiphonics and transient harmonics to sound as much as
possible and do not adjust them back to known pure harmonics unnecessarily.

\textbf{Al-kitab al-khamr} was written between January and April 2015 for
Ensemble Dal Niente. The piece was premiered on the 16\textsuperscript{th} of
May 2015 on the campus of Harvard University by Ensemble Dal Niente.
