%\textbf{The winds \& percussion are tranposed.} The E$\flat$ clarinet sounds a
%minor third higher than written and the bass clarinet sounds a major ninth
%lower than written. The xylophone sounds an octave higher than written. (But
%note that the violin, viola and cello are all written at sounding pitch even
%for the low notes of their scordatura.)
%
%\textbf{Prioritization of tempo.} The proportions between tempi should be as
%exact as possible (even though the choice of tempi are to some extent a matter
%of the preferences of the ensemble and the acoustics of the hall). In addition,
%the tempi of the very fast parts of the piece should be played as closely as
%possible to the tempi written in the score: it is preferable to play the dense
%figures in very fast parts of the piece as something of a blur rather than
%slowing the tempi to attack each of the notes carefully. Speed and forcefulness
%of tempo must take priority throughout the piece.
%
%\textbf{Oboe \& clarinet.} All trills are color trills. Color fingerings are
%given as circled Arabic numerals with greater numbers indicating greater
%deviation from normal timbre.
%
%\textbf{Piano and harpsichord.} The pianist is asked to switch between piano
%and harpsichord throughout the piece. The two instruments should be positioned
%right next to each other so that the pianist can switch rapidly. Register
%settings for the harpsichord are encouraged even though none are given in the
%score. The harpsichord should be amplified considerably. Piano and harpsichord
%clusters are all chromatic.
%
%\textbf{Percussion.} Seven instruments are required: (1.) a single crotale
%(pitched in D$\natural$); (2.) a piece of slate scraped by an even smaller
%piece of slate or another stone; (3.) a snare drum (played with the fingertips
%and never with sticks); (4.) a large sponge whisked across the suface of a bass
%drum; (5.) a single suspended cymbal (pitched as low as possible and played
%with a soft yarn mallet); (6.) a tam-tam (as large as possible); (7.) and a
%xylophone. A few of the switches between instrument are extremely fast. In
%cases where it is not possible to effect the switch as quickly as written, the
%last few notes of the previous material should be sacrificed so that the first
%few notes of the next material begin on time. \textbf{The five-line staff always
%indicates the xylophone.}
%
%\textbf{Strings.} The the lowest strings of violin, viola and cello are all
%detuned: the lowest string of the violin should be taken down one semitone to
%F$\sharp$4; the lowest string of the viola should be taken down two semitones
%to B$\flat$2; and the lowest string of the cello should be taken down three
%semitones to A$\natural$1. In addition, the violinist is asked to play on a
%large piece of slate at one point in the piece; the slate (and small stone used
%for scraping in a circle) are to resemble those of the percussionist as closely
%as possible. Tremolo are all fast and uncounted.
