M8 [pizzicati fantastiques] is written into [1]. M8 [pizzicati fantastiques]
climaxes in [1].

M16 [extremely long string tremolo descent] begins in [1]. M16 [extremely long
string tremolo descent] ends at the start of [3].

M4 [contrabass halo] is written into [1], [2], [3]. M4 [contrabass halo] ends
at the start of [3]. M4 [contrabass halo] beaves as an independent layer.

M5 [extremely quiet low winds] is written into [1], [4], [5]. M5 [extremely
quiet low winds] in [1] privileges major and perfect intervals to forestall any
affect of the sinister.

M19 [piano lightning cadenza] is written into [1], [3], [4]. M19 [piano
lightning cadenza] in [1] foreshadows M19 [piano lightning cadenza] in [3] and
[4]. M19 [piano lightning cadenza] in [1] emerges from M8 [pizzicati
fantastiques].

M10 [tremoli fantastiques] is written into [1], [3]. M19 [piano lightning
cadenza] and M10 [tremoli fantastiques] are bound together in the piece.

M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] is written into [1], [5]. M6 [quiet
multiphonic complexes] never climaxes.

M5 [extremely quiet low winds] and M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] merge into
a composite during [1].

M5 [extremely quiet low winds] and M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] merge into
a composite during [5].

M8 [pizzicati fantastiques] becomes M10 [tremoli fantastiques] which in turn
becomes M12 [massed string trills].

SUMMARY. [1] initiates three longterm processes: M16 [extremely long string
tremolo descent], M15 [woodblock underspine] and M4 [contrabass halo]. M8
[pizzicati fantastiques] becomes M10 [tremoli fantastiques] which becomes M12
[massed string trills]. M5 [extremely quiet low winds] acts as an underlayer
and becomes M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes]. M19 [piano lightning cadenza]
appears for the first time and foreshadows M19 [piano lightning cadenza] later
in the piece.
