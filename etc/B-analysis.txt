what comes before? M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] come before. and possibly
also M10 [tremoli fantastiques] and even M19 [piano lightning cadenza].

M12 [massed string trills] is written to occur as a primary material only in
[B]. so it makes sense for M12 to maximize in [B] if M12 wants to maximize in
the piece. of course M12 co-occurs with materials in the opening stages of [D].
and M12 may co-occur with materials in other stages, too. feels like the
version of M12 that occurs here is incredibly quiet. so the material is a type
of massed backdrop. and possibly one that may on much longer than a backdrop
would be expected to last. dynamic enveloping works really well here. so it's
possible that dynamic enveloping starts with at the end of [A] and continues
into the start of [B]. all the time techniques work, too. so this may be a
really good place to front two or three of the time techniques relatively early
in the piece.

M4 [contrabass halo] occurs in [A], [B] and [C]. and so the occurrence in [B]
sits in the middle of the other two. M4 probabaly never climaxes. M4 is
probabaly only ever revealed or hidden or put in counterpoint with the other
materials. M3 [dialoguing wind solos] follow M4 or come at the same time as M4.
the materials conceivably layer and work incredibly well together in true
counterpoint. so perhaps M4 and M3 begin together at the same time in [B]. it's
also possible that the pitch-content of M4 is restricted everywhere in the
piece. a glissando lentissimo played on changing harmonics and half harmonics
may be enough. in fact it may be that the three occurrences of M4 in the piece
are all exposures of a slow-moving but deeply parametric line. probably notated
on a single staff but probabaly notated with a number of transition spanners.
which will mean that M4 derives from ins wasser. M12 probabaly leaks into M4.
which may mean that ...
