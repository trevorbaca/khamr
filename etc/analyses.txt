PITCH APPLICATION. shared register with relatively large number of simultaneous
voices makes a strictly canonic or interruptedly canonic application of pitches
possible. can be exact figure repetition of pitch, rhythm and dynamics first in
piccolo then in violin then in sopranino sax then in clarinet and so on. amount
of time between entry of voices can be constantly varied. this then enables the
ability to loop on a single extant figure. looping can begin first in one or
two voices while the remaining voices continue to state new pitch material.
looping can then grow to encompass most or all voices. once looping is in place
pitches can be added one at a time to all loops. once looping is in place
pitches can be removed one at a time from all loops. there's also the
possibility of canonic treatment with the same pitches between parts but with
different rhythms between parts. there's even the possibility of rests coming
in the middle of figures to effectively sever loops into two or three shards
differently in different voices.

VARATIONS. legato figures can be subito swapped out for tongued and off-string
figures. legato figures and tongued / off-string figures can interpolate.

2: GUIRO.

VARIATIONS. four versions of material. first version uses credit cards against
almost all white or black piano keys and almost all marimba resonators. second
version uses wire brushes on the same. third version uses bursts of the usual
guiro sound on two different actual guiros treated as auxiliary percussion and
with credit cards being run in quick bursts against short segments of piano
keys and short segments of marimba resonators.

FULL SCORING. material doesn't appear fully scored. material appears admixed
with other materials. material sometimes appears below other materials when
other materials disappear.

2(P): PLASTIC SEAWEED GUIRO.

    credit card run somewhat slowly on first auxiliary guiro
    credit card run somehwat slowly on second auxiliary guiro

    wire brushes run somewhat slowly on first auxiliary guiro
    wire brushes run somewhat slowly on second auxiliary guiro
    wire brushes on almost all white or black piano keys

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT. development is possible with phasing between the players.
material begins with each player glissing at different rate. players then find
their way into glissing at the same rate. looping then sets in on glisses that
function at the same rate. loops then grow out of phase from each other. loop
version of material transitions into burst guiro.

    credit card run quickly on first auxiliary guiro
    credit card run quickly on second auxiliary guiro
    credit card run quickly on short segment of white or black piano keys

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT. short bursts are assertive. can be used antiphonally
between piano and marimba. can be used anitphonally between all four players.
bursts become closer together. bursts become further apart. begins antiphonally
between two players. then becomes rotational between three players. then
becomes rotational between four players. then becomes two-part antiphonal
between the four players grouped as two pairs.

no need for internal development.

no need for looping.

RHETORIC. even if used for an extended period of time the material will
function to punctuate other materials. material can used to dwarf and
effectively reframe the sound of even the very large tam-tam. material can also
be used to stomp on top of a fortissimo full-ensemble texture. particularly
effective if the process of stomping is mechanical and of insistent dynamics
(but with a few rhythmic irregularities) and if the response of the tutti
remainder of the ensemble is to decrescendo rather a lot at first but then to
take much longer than expected to complete the final stage of the decrescendo
from piano to pianissisimo. note that the stomping of the jarring guiro
probably brings the music to pianissisimo rather than to niente to provide a
way for the energy of the piece to begin building back up after an interesting
amount of time. and the most interesting amount of time might be rather a lot
of time such that a significant period of the music is heard tutti
pianississimo as though distantly underwater. all of this means that only one
region of jarring guiro appears in the piece. how is the jarring guiro
approached? probabaly just appears out of nowhere and makes the best music when
music with the quality of ferocious multiphonics is present at the first
appearance of the material. there's a particularly good out-transition
available with the appearance of whirly tubes and tibetan bowls played over the
pianississimo induced by the stomping-out of the jarring guiro.

VARIATIONS. there's a dramatic variation available that enters the quiet
version of this material subito from a very loud version of this material.
there's also a version of this material that asks the players to all play ppppp
(and omits the english horn). the ultraquiet version of this material makes for
an incredible backdrop. a solo or dialogue of solos may be introduced over the
backdrop.

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT. very slow crescendi are possible. very slow decrescendi
are possible. the string subset of the material can transition very slow
towards the bridge and away. the string subset of the material can transition
from very slow bow to very fast bow and back. in fact the combination of tutti
fast bow flautando over the winds is very attractive. as is tutti scratch over
the winds.

time treatments mostly do not apply when material manifests as fixed chord.
time treatments do apply when material manifests with changing pitches or even
very slowly changing pitches. in fact there's a way to get the time treatments
to apply even in the scoring of a fixed chord with color deviation fingerings
in the winds and microtonal deviations in the strings. in fact pervasive
deviation means that the material can be effected at all tempi from extremely
slow to extremely fast. can even use 3- to 5-note 24-ET microtonal ascents or
descents as a way of animating the material for time treatment.

RHETORIC. material possibly effects submarine states. if this is true then the
subito change from forte to piano may represent the overhead passing on of
unaltered experience.

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT. doesn't need to be too much internal development.
crescendi and decrescendi are possible in all parts. there's a potentially
striking version of the material played pp in all parts which attenuates the
forceful color of the archetypical version of the material. this kind of gritty
pastel version of the material can lie latent for some time while other events
happen on top. then the gritty pastel version of the material gradually or
suddenly intensifies and completely overwhelms whatever other layers are
active. there's also the possibility of gradually moving the register of the
multiphonics either up or down while at the same time moving the register of
the distorted strings either up or down.

RHETORIC. lying-in-wait. the quiet version of the mateiral lying in wait while
something seemingly dramatic happens superimposed on top will really work. then
the quiet version becomes the ferocious version.

18: CHINA CYMBAL MIASMA.

ARCHETYPE.

    slow-moving color-enveloped rolled china cymbal with fortississimo peaks

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT. three different processes play out. the first moves the
position of the rolled mallets from the lip of the cymbal to the center of the
cymbal. the second effects an unbelievably dramatic crescendo that possibly
necessitates a quick mallet change from yarn to wood. the third process moves
from the 22" cymbal to the 27" cymbal in the form of a quiet crossfade from the
one to the other. the zargun color of the haze transforms during crossfade. a
fourth process possibly increases or decreases the reiteration rate inside the
tremolo especially when the tremolo is loud.

no looping.

RHETORIC. sounds like the material goes and away and comes back quite a number
of times. this gives the effect of the presence of the material for a very long
time. sounds like material first appears on 22" cymbal and only later migrates
to 27" cymbal. also sounds like crossfaded migration from 22" cymbal to 27"
cymbal is worked out in a very dramatic way and is accompanied by probabaly a
pianississimo texture in the sustaining instruments. magic resonant guitar
notes can also appear in part of the miasma as though discovered in the middle
of the haze. interesting in-transition provided by circle-scraped hand-held
almglocken in the orchestration of the static wind chord that precedes the
appearance of the miasma.

PERFORMANCE TECHNIQUE. white-key or chromatic scalar fragments. looping to
pool up and build energy is a strong possibility. looping first on the stopped
strings to pool up and build energy could be incredibly dramatic. trills make
sense in the material. chained trills make an especially strong amount of sense
in the material.

NOTATION. single staff probably suffices. open question as to whether graces or
extremely fast note values make more sense. third option is smaller notes
without rhythmic specification. it's also possible to use the double-stemmed
toccata notation to accent the first element some or all figures during regions
of the cadenza and to give speed to the material incredibly.

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT. does the cadenza expire in the extreme upper registers of
the instrument to avoid returning to the muted strings? does the cadenza visit
the lower registers of the instrument at some point to encourage low-register
energy and coax the brown colors of a low-register prestissimo? note that
because the material moves so fast it can be used extensively in the piece to
bear the continued presence of incredibly fast movement.

ORCHESTRATION. is the material an extension of the upper register prestissimo?
is the material a precursor of the upper register prestissimo? the material
pairs well with almost everything. the material also spins off into the high
instruments incredibly easily in the passing of exact fragments from the piano
writing to the piccolo, b-flat clarinet, sopranino or alto sax and oboe.

RHETORIC. dramatic way to develop material starts with cadenza on only muted
strings and then moves cadenza to open strings to pick up energy, brightness
and loudness. cadenza keeps trying to get started during beginning of piece.
this means cadenza keeps trying to get started on muted strings with broken
rhythms and fragments that are not yet fully running-scalar. this means that
there's a primordial form of the material that starts with perforated
pointillism on the muted strings together with single points or hits in the
other instruments. the nonpitched percussion instruments include castanets,
single forceful guiro strokes, single maraca shakes, single snare hits, single
dead snare hits, single bass drum hits, single dead bass drum hits, single
woodblock hits, single dead woodblock hits. true pizzicati in the guitar and
strings also make sense, especially dead pizzicati and even batrok pizzicati.
this primordial form of the material is the homeland of dead strokes and dead
hits. there are so many pathways into and out of the material. any of the
textural materials compressed to a single octave or a ninth or tenth make for a
dramatic lead-in to this material. if the cadenza expires in the extreme
register of the instrument on the open strings then the cadenza leads perfectly
into the electric string tremolo and maracas. the cadenza also leads perfectly
into massed shakers. the cadenza also interacts extremely well with a
fortissimo snare roll. what is the rhetoric of interaction between the cadenza
and snare roll? the snare roll can try to force the cadenza to cease two or
three times before being completely overwhelmed by the cadenza when the cadenza
acquires a critical amount of energy or descends into the lowest registers of
the piano. this is possible even with an incredibly forceful snare roll. so
this provides a way of presenting the saturated versions of two materials in
counterpoint at one time. once the cadenza descends into the lowest registers
of the instrument it becomes possible to activate the low register version of
the ferocious multiphonics. what this shows is that the cadenza functions as
the activator of a large number of the saturated versions of the materials in
the piece. the upper-registers parts of the cadenza activate the upper-register
materials. the lower-register parts of the cadenza activate the lower-register
materials. there are also a number of lovely contrast pathways. massed
off-string bowing layers incredibly well as a type of luminescent haze over
parts of the couse of the cadenza. massed string trills layer incredibly well
as a type of lumicescent haze over parts of the course of the cadenza.
castanets combined with the regions of luminescent haze will be incredible.

LOOPING. does the cadenza get caught in loops? if the cadenza gets caught in
loops on the open strings then it makes sense to pair an insistent scalar loop
in the piano with an exactly cosynchronous forceful stroke against the guiro.
the insistence on both will provide a type of energy that can only come from
that combination. the cadenza can also get caught in big loops of 30 or 40
extremely rapid pitches. long cadenza loops will timescale extremely
effectively. long cadenza loops will pair extremely effectively with the china
cymbal miasma and with the tam-tams.
