PITCH APPLICATION. shared register with relatively large number of simultaneous
voices makes a strictly canonic or interruptedly canonic application of pitches
possible. can be exact figure repetition of pitch, rhythm and dynamics first in
piccolo then in violin then in sopranino sax then in clarinet and so on. amount
of time between entry of voices can be constantly varied. this then enables the
ability to loop on a single extant figure. looping can begin first in one or
two voices while the remaining voices continue to state new pitch material.
looping can then grow to encompass most or all voices. once looping is in place
pitches can be added one at a time to all loops. once looping is in place
pitches can be removed one at a time from all loops. there's also the
possibility of canonic treatment with the same pitches between parts but with
different rhythms between parts. there's even the possibility of rests coming
in the middle of figures to effectively sever loops into two or three shards
differently in different voices.

VARATIONS. legato figures can be subito swapped out for tongued and off-string
figures. legato figures and tongued / off-string figures can interpolate.
