PITCH APPLICATION. shared register with relatively large number of simultaneous
voices makes a strictly canonic or interruptedly canonic application of pitches
possible. can be exact figure repetition of pitch, rhythm and dynamics first in
piccolo then in violin then in sopranino sax then in clarinet and so on. amount
of time between entry of voices can be constantly varied. this then enables the
ability to loop on a single extant figure. looping can begin first in one or
two voices while the remaining voices continue to state new pitch material.
looping can then grow to encompass most or all voices. once looping is in place
pitches can be added one at a time to all loops. once looping is in place
pitches can be removed one at a time from all loops. there's also the
possibility of canonic treatment with the same pitches between parts but with
different rhythms between parts. there's even the possibility of rests coming
in the middle of figures to effectively sever loops into two or three shards
differently in different voices.

figures. legato figures and tongued / off-string figures can interpolate.

VARIATIONS. there's a dramatic variation available that enters the quiet
version of this material subito from a very loud version of this material.
there's also a version of this material that asks the players to all play
ppppp (and which might omit the english horn). the ultraquiet version of this
material makes for an incredible backdrop. a solo or dialogue of solos may be
introduced over the backdrop.

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT. very slow crescendi are possible. very slow decrescendi
are possible. the string subset of the material can transition very slow
towards the bridge and away. the string subset of the material can transition
from very slow bow to very fast bow and back. in fact the combination of tutti
fast bow flautando over the winds is very attractive. as is tutti scratch over
the winds.

BLOCK CHANGES. block changes of dynamic in the winds but the strings. block
changes of dynamic in the strings but not the winds. block changes of color in
the strings but not the winds. block changes of tempo in the winds but not the
strings. block changes of tempo in the strings but not the winds.

time treatments mostly do not apply when material manifests as fixed chord.
time treatments do apply when material manifests with changing pitches or even
very slowly changing pitches. in fact there's a way to get the time treatments
to apply even in the scoring of a fixed chord with color deviation fingerings
in the winds and microtonal deviations in the strings. in fact pervasive
deviation means that the material can be effected at all tempi from extremely
slow to extremely fast. can even use 3- to 5-note 24-ET microtonal ascents or
descents as a way of animating the material for time treatment.

RHETORIC. material possibly effects submarine states. if this is true then the
subito change from forte to piano may represent the overhead passing on of
unaltered experience.
