materials: 12, 4, 3, 18, 9, 4, 7

what comes before? five layers carry over from [A] into [B]:

    (M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes])
    (M15 [woodblock underspine])
    (M16 [extremely long string tremolo descent])
    (M10 [tremoli fantastiques] ==> M12 [massed string trills])
    (M4 [contrabass halo])

M12 [massed string trills] is written to occur as a primary material only in
[B]. (though M12 [massed string trills] cooccurs with materials in the opening
stages of [D].) M12 [massed string trills] maximizes in [B]. M12 [massed string
trills] is incredibly quiet in [B]. M12 [massed string trills] is a type of
massed backdrop in [B]. M12 [massed string trills] goes on much longer than a
backdrop would be expected to last. M12 [massed string trills] expresses
noticeable dynamic enveloping. dynamic enveloping starts with M10 [tremoli
fantastiques] at the end of [A] and continues into M12 [massed string trills]
at the start of [B]. M12 [massed string trills] in [B] expresses two or three
of the time techniques.

M4 [contrabass halo] occurs in [A], [B] and [C]. M4 [contrabass halo] in [B]
continues the independent layer established in [A] and prolonged into [C].

M18 [china cymbal miasma] is written into [B] and [D]. M18 [china cymbal
miasma] climaxes a first time on the 22" cymbal in [B] and a second time on the
27" cymbal in [D]. M18 [china cymbal miasma] glues together with the other
three materials already present in [B].

M12 [massed string trills], M4 [contrabass halo], M3 [dialoguing wind solos]
and M18 [china cymbal miasma] glue together near or at the beginning of [B] as
a type of almost-full-ensemble amalgam.

the presence of M9 [sostenuti fantastiques] in [B] after both M12 [massed
string trills] and M3 [dialoguing wind solos] suggests that either M12 [massed
string trills] or M3 [dialoguing wind solos] or both undergo a process of
interpolation and become M9 [sostenuti fantastiques]. do such processes of
interpolation necessarily effect a reduction of energy? not necessarily.
because the transition from a greater number of attacks to a lesser number of
attacks may be offset by a corresponding increase in dynamics.

this also means that there's a natural change in the disposition of materials
by the time M9 [sostenuti fantastiques] are fully in effect. which other
materials from [B] carry over into the M9 [sostenuti fantastiques]? conceivably
any of the previous four materials in [B] may carry over into M9 [sostenuti
fantastiques]. the limitation is that at least some of the strings in M12
[massed string trills] or some of the winds in M3 [dialoguing wind solos] or
some of both the strings and the winds will have to drop out of the previous
material and join M9 [sostenuti fantastiques]. so the option is available to
have all five of the first materials in [B] continue to be in effect by the
arrival of M9 [sostenuti fantastiques]. and that may be an effective way to
allow each of the materials more time to work their magic.

M7 [ferocious multiphonic complexes] is written to appear only at the end of
[B]. so if M7 [ferocious multiphonic complexes] wants to climax then it will
happen at the end of [B] and possibly carry over into the start of [C]. M3
[dialoguing wind solos] transitions to become M7 [ferocious multiphonic
complexes] during [B].

M18 [china cymbal miasma] and M7 [ferocious multiphonic complexes] both climax
in [B].
