materials: 8, 14, 4, 5, 19, 10, 6

what comes after? [B] begins with a fourway composite:

    M12 [massed string trills] 
    M4 [contrabass halo] 
    M3 [dialoguing wind solos]
    M18 [china cymbal miasma]

it's possible that one or more of the [B] start materials may leak backwards
into the end of [A].

M8 [pizzicati fantastiques] is written into the structure of only [A]. so if
the material is to climax it will climax during about the first two minutes of
the piece.

M14 [electric string tremolo & shakers] is written into the structure of the
piece all over the place. the occurrence of the material here in [A] is
probably reinterpreted as the start of M16 [extremely long string tremolo
descent] which then ends shortly after the start of [C].

M4 [contrabass halo] is written into the structure of [A], [B], [C]. so M4
[contrabass halo] territorializes the first three segments of the piece. this
also means that M4 [contrabass halo] may start very near the beginning of the
piece. this also means that M4 [contrabass halo] beaves as an independent layer
in very much the same way as M15 [woodblock underspine] and M16 [extremely long
string tremolo descent].

M5 [extremely quiet low winds] is written into the structure of [A], [D], [E].
the material probably never climaxes. how is M5 [extremely quiet low winds]
interpreted in [D] and [E]? [D] introduces M5 [extremely quiet low winds] as a
backdrop to M3 [dialoguing wind solos] and as the remains left over after the
violence of M17 [snare roll]. the material remains as a type of (possibly
intermittent) pedal for most of the rest of [D] which will add depth to most of
[D]. will the presence of M5 [extremely quiet low winds] impute an element of
the sinister? not necessarily. if the combination of contrabass clarinet and
baritone saxophone is treated as a pedal then any major or perfect interval
can be used to forestall the sinister. if the combination of contrabass
clarinet and baritone saxophone is treated as a pair of voices in counterpoint
then the moments of held conjunction between the two voices can be set to major
or perfect intervals for the same reason.

M19 [piano lightning cadenza] is written into the structure of [A], [C], [D].
M19 [piano lightning cadenza] in [A] will foreshadow M19 [piano lightning
cadenza] in [C], [D]. though the presentation of M19 [piano lightning cadenza]
in [A] may be relatively forceful or relatively long, or both. because M19
[piano lightning cadenza] combines effortlessly with all the preceding
materials in [A]. these are M8 [pizzicati fantastiques] and M5 [extremely quiet
low winds] as semantic materials in [A] and also the start of M16 [extremely
long string tremolo descent], M4 [contrabass halo] and M15 [woodblock
underspine].
