what comes before? [D] ends with a four-layer composite of M5 [extremely quiet
low winds], M19 [piano lightning cadenza], M18 [china cymbal miasma] and M14
[ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers]. M19 [piano lightning cadenza] and
M18 [china cymbal miasma] are climaxing by the end of [D] and probabaly
continue into the start of [E]. and there's also special handling of M14 [ppp
altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers] because the material will climax in [E]
and begins that process at the end of [D]. so M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo
& fff shakers] also crosses the boundary from the end of [D] into [E]. and the
version of M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers] that occurs at the
end of [D] and the beginning of [E] is probabaly a rain of shakers scattered
throughout the ensemble with the electric tremolo yet having been added in.

M2B [burst guiro] marks the beginning of [E]. it's possible that the
manifestation of M2B [burst guiro] here at the beginning of [E] is effected in
the form of jarring fff rattan across the resonators of the marimba. this means
that the percussionist will momentarily have to stop playing M18 [china cymbal
miasma] in order to grab the rattan and run it against the marimba. it's also
possible that the jarring fff rattan spawns a texture of smaller guiro bursts
throughout the ensemble, probabaly both before and after the appearance of the
fff rattan. after running the rattan against the marimba the percussionist can
return to the china cymbals. there's a particularly nice combination of
triangle together with the guiro bursts. so perhaps the composite texture
running through the ensemble are antiphonal guiro bursts together with triangle
hits.

it may turn out to be that the piece features a sustained but shifting climax
that begins in [D] and continues through almost all of [E]. this means that the
function of [E] will be to climax the piece and then provide whatever
concluding material is most effective.

M11 [massed off-string bowing] is written into the structure of only [E]. the
material will not assert over the dynamics of M18 [china cymbal miasma] or M14
[rain of shakers]. although it's possible that M11 [massed off-string bowing]
will pair incredibly well with the M19 [piano lightning cadenza]. so perhaps
M11 [massed off-string bowing] is used as a type of foam in relief of M19
[piano lightning cadenza].

the fully orchestrated form of M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers]
may not climax in [E] because the material is too close to the end of the piece
to climax in that way. it may be that the shakers-only form of the material is
combined with piccolo fluttertongue but not with electric string tremolo. it is
possible that ppp altissimo string tremolo appears. if this is the case then
the M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers] combines extremely well
with M1 [upper-register prestissimo], M18 [china cymbal miasma], M19 [piano
lightning cadenza] and M20 [whirly tubes]. M18 [china cymbal miasma] and M19
[piano lightning cadenza] are already present and climaxing at the start of
[E]. and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] is specified as the last material in
the piece. so perhaps M1 [upper-register prestissimo] adds into [E] at the
moment when M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers] begins. it's also
clear that the climaxing of M18 [china cymbal miasma] is actually a composite
with loudly struck tam-tam. the tam-tam will complete the spectral space opened
by the other materials. also sounds like M19 [piano lightning cadenza] will be
in basso furioso by this point.

M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] will manifest as a single b-flat clarinet
multiphonic used as a type of background color pedal behind the activity of the
layered climaxes. it's possible that a lingering version of the quiet clarinet
multiphonic appears after the layered climaxes subside. which may suggest an
ending sequence for the entire piece. if so then there's a dramatic version of
M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] that layers in quiet multiphonics in the bass
flute, bass clarinet and baritone sax all at ppp.  

M2A [seaweed guiro] is written into the structure at the end of [C] and here at
the end of [E]. so some decision has to be made about the relationship between
the two appearances of the material. it feels like the appearances of the
material reference each other but probably aren't identical. which means that
the appearance here at the end of [E] is probably much less present or much
more present than the occurrence at the end of [C], depending on the overall
way the piece closes.

M5 [extremely quiet low winds] and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] written into
the end of the piece means that both very high and very low materials are
present near the end of the piece. so the piece has the option of ending with
only the very high, with only the very low or with both the very high and the
very low together.

it's possible that M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] and M5 [extremely quiet low
winds] in [E] are the same material. it's also possible that M6 [quiet
multiphonic complexes] becomes M5 [extremely quiet low winds] through a
process of decreasing multiphonic content and increasing pure pitch content.
