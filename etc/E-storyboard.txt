what comes before? four different layers carry over from [D] into [E]:

    (M5 [extremely quiet low winds])
    (M19 [piano lightning cadenza])
    (M18 [china cymbal miasma])
    (M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers])

the version of M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers] that occurs at
the end of [D] and the beginning of [E] is does not yet include string tremolo.

M2B [burst guiro] marks the beginning of [E]. M2B [burst guiro] here at the
beginning of [E] is orchestrated as jarring fff rattan across the resonators of
the marimba. the percussionist will momentarily have to stop playing M18 [china
cymbal miasma] in order to grab rattan and run it against the marimba. it's
also possible that the jarring fff rattan spawns a texture of smaller guiro
bursts throughout the ensemble both before and after the appearance of the fff
rattan. the percussionist can return to the china cymbals after running rattan
against the marimba.

it may turn out to be that the piece features a sustained but shifting climax
that begins in [D] and continues through almost all of [E].

M11 [massed off-string bowing] is written into the structure of only [E]. the
material will not assert over the dynamics of M18 [china cymbal miasma] or M14
[ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers]. although it's possible that M11
[massed off-string bowing] will pair incredibly well with the M19 [piano
lightning cadenza]. so perhaps M11 [massed off-string bowing] is a type of foam
used in relief of M19 [piano lightning cadenza].

the orchestration of M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers] that
climaxes in [E] uses only ppp altissimo string tremolo rather than fff
altissimo string tremolo. M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers]
combines extremely well with M1 [upper-register prestissimo], M18 [china cymbal
miasma], M19 [piano lightning cadenza] and M20 [whirly tubes]. M18 [china
cymbal miasma] and M19 [piano lightning cadenza] are already present and
climaxing at the start of [E]. and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] is specified
as the last material in the piece. so perhaps M1 [upper-register prestissimo]
adds into [E] at the moment when M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff
shakers] begins. it's also clear that the climaxing of M18 [china cymbal
miasma] is actually a composite with loudly struck tam-tam. the tam-tam will
complete the spectral space opened by the other materials.

M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] will manifest as a single b-flat clarinet
multiphonic used as a type of background color pedal behind the activity of the
layered climaxes. it's possible that a lingering version of the quiet clarinet
multiphonic appears after the layered climaxes subside. which may suggest an
ending sequence for the entire piece. if so then there's a dramatic version of
M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] that layers in quiet multiphonics in the bass
flute, bass clarinet and baritone sax all at ppp.  

M2A [seaweed guiro] is written into the structure at the end of [C] and at the
end of [E]. the appearance of M2A [seaweed guiro] at the end of [C] is fully
orchestrated. the appearance of M2A [seaweed guiro] at the end of [E] is much
more lightly orchestrated. the appearance of M2A [seaweed guiro] at the end of
[E] calls the appearance of M2a [seaweed guiro] at the end of [C] in only a
dreamlike way.

M5 [extremely quiet low winds] and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] are both
written into the end of the piece. this means that the piece has the option of
ending with only the very high, with only the very low or with both the very
high and the very low together.

M6 [quiet multiphonic complexes] becomes M5 [extremely quiet low winds] through
a process of decreasing multiphonic content and increasing pure pitch content.

SUMMARY. [E] internally varies a single saturated color composite sustained
until the end with only a daub of celestial color added as a finishing stroke.
the composite color yokes four materials together: M7 [ferocious multiphonic
complexes] + M19 [piano lightning cadenza: very low & very loud] + M18 [china
cymbal miasma: maximum] + M14 [ppp altissimo string tremolo & fff shakers].
