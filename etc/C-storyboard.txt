materials: 16, 19, 10, 4, 3, 1, 2A

what comes before? three different layers carry over from [B] into [C]:

    (M18 [china cymbal miasma])
    (M9 [sostenuti fantastiques])
    (M7 [ferocious multiphonic complexes])

what follows after? one layer carries over from [C] into [D]:

    (M2A [seaweed guiro])

M16 [extremely long string tremolo descent] terminates at the start of [C]. M16
[extremely long string tremolo descent] territorializes [A] and [B] for about
four minutes of music. M16 [extremely long string tremolo descent] is
perforated to appear only intermittently. the ability to restart the material
from something close to the last pitch allows for perceptual continuity.

M19 [piano lightning cadenza] is written into the structure of [A], [C] and
[D]. M19 [piano lighning cadenza] crosses over from [D] to [E]. M19 [piano
lightning cadenza] climaxes in [E]. M19 [piano lightning cadenza] in [C]
foreshadows the start of M19 [piano lightning cadenza] at the end of [D].

M10 [tremoli fantastiques] is written into the structure of [A] and [C]. M10
[tremoli fantastiques] follows immediately after M19 [piano lightning cadenza]
in both [A] and [C]. so it is likely that M19 [piano lightning cadenza] and M10
[tremoli fantastiques] are bonded together in the piece. this may mean that the
final appearance of M19 [piano lightning cadenza] in [D] and [E] is also
accompanied by M10 [tremoli fantastiques] even though M10 [tremoli
fantastiques] is not written into the structure of either [D] or [E].

M4 [contrabass halo] is written into the structure of [A], [B] and [C]. so the
occurrence of M4 [contrabass halo] in [C] marks the farewell appearance of M4
[contrabass halo] in the piece. M4 [contrabass halo] probably never climaxes.
what type of process of presentation characterizes M4 [contrabass halo]
throughout [A], [B], [C]? M4 [contrabass halo] is probably only ever revealed
in windows between other materials. M4 [contrabass halo] is followed
immediately by M3 [dialoguing wind solos] in [B] and here in [C]. M4
[contrabass halo] and M3 [dialoguing wind solos] layer well together. it is
possible that M4 [contrabass halo] is sometimes a third partner in M3
[dialoguing wind solos]. M4 [contrabass halo] and M3 [dialoguing wind solos]
begin at the same time here in [C] just as they did earlier in [B]. occurrences
of M3 [dialoguing wind solos] later in the piece after [C] are not
shadow-accompanied by M4 [contrabass halo] because M4 [contrabass halo]
territorializes only [A], [B], [C].

M3 [dialoguing wind solos] is written into the structure of [B], [C], [D]. M3
[dialoguing wind solos] in [B] undergoes a transformation into M9 [sostenuti
fantastiques]. here in [C] there is no structural reason to transform M3
[dialoguing wind solos] into another material. M3 [dialoguing wind solos] here
in [C] may continue all way into [D]. what is the fate of M3 [dialoguing wind
solos] once the material crosses into [D]? the material is transformed into M5
[extremely quiet low winds] in [D] by the ferocity of M17 [snare roll] in [D].

M1 [upper-register prestissimo] is written into the structure in only [C] and
[E]. which means that M1 [upper-register prestissimo] climaxes here in [C].
it's possible that M1 [upper-register prestissimo] starts very near the
beginning of [C] and territorializes most of [C]. M3 [dialoguing wind solos]
and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] may alternate in [C]. M3 [dialoguing wind
solos] and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] may layer in [C]. the combination of
M3 [dialoguing wind solos] and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] territorializes
most of [C].

M2A [seaweed guiro] is written into the structure of [C] and [E]. M2A [seaweed
guiro] is used as only a passing glance backwards in [E]. M2A [seaweed guiro]
is probabaly used only very lightly here in [C], too. M2A [seaweed guiro] may
function to bring M1 [upper-register prestissimo] to conclusion. M2A [seaweed
guiro] crosses over into the start of [D].
