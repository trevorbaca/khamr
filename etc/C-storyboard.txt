materials: 14, 19, 10, 4, 3, 1, 2a

what comes before? three different layers carry over from [B] into [C]:

    (M18 [china cymbal miasma])
    (M9 [sostenuti fantastiques])
    (M7 [ferocious multiphonic complexes])

what follows after? one layer carries over from [C] into [D]:

    (M2A [seaweed guiro])

M16 [extremely long string tremolo descent] terminates at the start of [C]. M16
[extremely long string tremolo descent] territorializes [A] and [B] for about
four minutes of music. M16 [extremely long string tremolo descent] is
perforated to appear only intermittently. the ability to restart the material
from something close to the last pitch allows for perceptual continuity.

M19 [piano lightning cadenza] is written into the structure of [A], [C] and
[D] and crosses over into [E]. M19 [piano lightning cadenza] climaxes in [E].
the occurrence of M19 [piano lightning cadenza] in [C] functions to foreshadow
the start of the material at the end of [D].

M10 [tremoli fantastiques] is written into the structure of [A] and [C]. M10
[tremoli fantastiques] follows immediately after M19 [piano lightning cadenza]
in both [A] and [C]. so it is likely that M19 [piano lightning cadenza]
and M10 [tremoli fantastiques] are bonded together in the piece. this may also
mean that the final appearance of M19 [piano lightning cadenza] in [D] and [E]
may also be accompanied by M10 [tremoli fantastiques] even though M10 [tremoli
fantastiques] is not written into the structure of either [D] or [E].

M4 [contrabass halo] is written into the structure of [A], [B] and [C]. so the
occurrence of M4 [contrabass halo] in [C] marks the last appearance of the
material in the piece. M4 [contrabass halo] probably never climaxes. M4
[contrabass halo] territorializes the first three segments of the piece. what
type of process of presentation characterizes M4 [contrabass halo] throughout
[A], [B], [C]? M4 [contrabass halo] is probably only ever revealed in windows
between other materials. M4 [contrabass halo] is followed immediately by M3
[dialoguing wind solos] in both [B] and here in [C]. M4 [contrabass halo] and
M3 [dialoguing wind solos] layer well together. it is possible that M4
[contrabass halo] is sometimes a third partner in M3 [dialoguing wind solos].
at the very least M4 [contrabass halo] and M3 [dialoguing wind solos] begin at
the same time here in [C] just as they did earlier in [B]. occurrences of M3
[dialoguing wind solos] later in the piece after [C] are not shadow-accompanied
by M4 [contrabass halo] because M4 [contrabass halo] territorializes [A], [B],
[C] only.

M3 [dialoguing wind solos] is written into the structure of [B], [C], [D]. M3
[dialoguing wind solos] earlier in [B] undergoes a transformation into M9
[sostenuti fantastiques]. here in [C] there is no structural reason to
transform M3 [dialoguing wind solos] into another material. M3 [dialoguing wind
solos] here in [C] may continue all way into [D]. what is the fate of M3
[dialoguing wind solos] once the material crosses into [D]? the material is
transformed into M5 [extremely quiet low winds] in [D] by the ferocity of M17
[snare roll] in [D].

M1 [upper-register prestissimo] is written into the structure in only [C] and
[E]. which means that M1 [upper-register prestissimo] climaxes here in [C].
it's possible that M1 [upper-register prestissimo] starts very near the
beginning of [C] and territorializes most of [C]. M3 [dialoguing wind solos]
and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] may alternate in [C]. M3 [dialoguing wind
solos] and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] may layer in [C]. the combination of
M3 [dialoguing wind solos] and M1 [upper-register prestissimo] territorializes
most of [C].

M2A [seaweed guiro] is written into the structure of [C] and [E]. M2A [seaweed
guiro] is used as only a passing glance backwards in [E]. and M2A [seaweed
guiro] is probabaly used only very lightly here in [C], too. M2A [seaweed
guiro] may function to bring M1 [upper-register prestissimo] to conclusion. M2A
[seaweed guiro] crosses over into the start of [D].
