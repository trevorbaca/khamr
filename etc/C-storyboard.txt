materials: 14, 19, 10, 4, 3, 1, 2a

what comes before? [B] ends in a field of densely saturated color. probably all
parts of the field leak over into the start of [C]. the field with which [B]
ends comprises M18 [china cymbal miasma], M9 [sostenuti fantastiques] and M7
[ferocious multiphonic complexes].

what follows after? M2a [seaweed guiro] in [C] probabaly leaks into the start
of [D] with M3 [dialoguing wind solos] and possibly M17 [snare roll]. so [D]
will start with M3 [dialoguing wind solos] and probably be followed immediately
by an incredibly forceful fffff M17 [snare roll].

M14 [electric string tremolo & maracas] is written into the structure of [A],
[C], [D] and [E]. M14 [electric string tremolo & maracas] climaxes somewhat
before the end of the piece in [E]. so the appearance here in [C] is definitely
not a climax and may instead look backwards to the appearance of the material
near the beginning of the piece in [A]. this may come out to mean that M14
[electric string tremolo & maracas] here in [C] marks the endpoint of M16
[extremely long string tremolo descent]. these materials connect because both
M14 [electric string tremolo & maracas] and M16 [extremely long string tremolo
descent] comprise tremolo. if that is the case then M16 [extremely long string
tremolo descent] territorializes [A] and [B] for about four minutes of music.
this suggests M16 [extremely long string tremolo descent] is perforated to
appear only intermittently. the ability to restart the material from something
close to the last pitch ensures continuity of material. 

M19 [piano lightning cadenza] is written into the structure of [A], [C] and
[D] and crosses over into [E]. M19 [piano lightning cadenza] climaxes in [E].
the occurrence of M19 [piano lightning cadenza] in [C] functions to foreshadow
the start of the material at the end of [D].

M10 [tremoli fantastiques] is written into the structure of [A] and [C]. it is
possible that the material climaxes early in the piece in [A]. but it is also
possible that the material climaxes here in [C]. either way it sounds like M10
[tremoli fantastiques] starts at the beginning of [C] together with M19 [piano
lightning cadenza].

M4 [contrabass halo] is written into the structure of [A], [B] and [C]. so the
occurrence of M4 [contrabass halo] in [C] marks the last appearance of the
material in the piece. but M4 [contrabass halo] probably never climaxes. and M4
[contrabass halo] territorializes the first three segments of the piece. what
type of process of presentation characterizes M4 [contrabass halo] throughout
[A], [B], [C]? M4 [contrabass halo] is probably only ever revealed between
other materials. note that M4 [contrabass halo] is followed immediately by M3
[dialoguing wind solos] in both [B] and here in [C]. these two materials layer
well together. so it is possible that M4 [contrabass halo] is sometimes a third
partner in M3 [dialoguing wind solos]. at the very least M4 [contrabass halo]
and M3 [dialoguing wind solos] begin at the same time here in [C] just as they
did earlier in [B].

M3 [dialoguing wind solos] is written into the structure of [B], [C], [D]. M3
[dialoguing wind solos] earlier in [B] undergoes a transformation into M9
[sostenuti fantastiques]. here there is no structural reason to transform M3
[dialoguing wind solos] into another material in [C]. and it sounds like M3
[dialoguing wind solos] in [C] may continue all way into [D]. what is the fate
of M3 [dialoguing wind solos] once the material crosses into [D]? the material
is transformed into M5 [extremely quiet low winds] in [D] by the ferocity of
M17 [snare roll] in [D].
