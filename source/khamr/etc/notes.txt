Al-kitab al-khamr notes
=======================

woodblock (or knitting needle) even rhythm ostinato at immediate beginning.
persists for almost two or three minutes in straight-up defiance of all other
musci (including tempo changes). then music stops, notices ostinato and then
pounces like sudden weather on ostinato.

rourke intoxication: an in-synch element persists in normal flow; progressively
becomes activated or disturbed; eventually hit wall or slide into warm bath of
complicity; then upper strata of prior music continue but heard at a distance
and through an experiential filter.

strategy for elimination of repeated pitches in single layer: just tie back to
previous pitch (possibly changing intervening rests to pitches).

mounted castanets: can play with held castanets;
whirly tubes;
bell plates can go low;
three tam-tams;

china cymbal: really big one below fundamental = awesome; (27": nick has, most
don't). also 22" exists and is nick's second-largest size. also sounds totally
awesome, though definitely brighter overall. bowing works on both. more than
20" ring on 27" after bowing forcefully. tremolo in from lip to center changes
spectral content. 24" ride cymbal.

sabian thundersheet. made from bronze cymbal alloy. can rub directly with
wooden mallet for opening of gigantic creaky door. bowing works but goes away
pretty soon afterwards. bowing the corners produces a different sound than
bowing the center. solution: right the color (and / or degree of force) and let
the percussionist figure it out.

waterphone!? tan dun and george crumb. noncliched use? controlled intervals:
only one or two at a time. then the portmaneto can be applied. usually bowed
but can be struck. invented by richard waters.

two held almglocken rubber against each other circularly. aweome bc of gritty
texture.

log drums. six pitches available. high and low on each differing by about a
minor third.

"boobam": similar quality to log drum. 

super long durated rainstick. also: ocean drum: like bass rainstick with a lot
of dynamic control. also functions as buzzy framedrum. really does sound like
waves breaking on rocks. can be made to go forever.

tempe bowl sounds exactly as in ray lynch sky of mind. singing bowl technique
works with rubber mallet and is actually great. with WHIRLY TUBES.

get list of exact pitches from nick for temple bowls.
